## Code in Place 2025: My Final Submission 🚀💻✨

Welcome to the README.md for my final project! This course has been an incredible journey, and I'm thrilled to share what I've learned. 🎓

## 🎓 About Code in Place 💻

Code in Place is a truly fantastic and free introductory programming course, meticulously designed to introduce the world of coding through the versatile Python language. 🐍 Its curriculum is directly inspired by the first half of Stanford University's highly-regarded introductory computer science course, CS106A.

## 💡 No Prior Experience? No Problem! ✨

This course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience. Whether you've never even considered what a "variable" is, or if the thought of writing a single line of code seems daunting, this course was crafted with YOU in mind! 👶➡️👨‍💻

## 📚 What You Get (and Don't Get!) 🎯

This course does not provide a formal grade or university credit. 📜 Instead, it focuses on the acquisition of practical skills and knowledge.

## ✨ The Real Reward: A New Skill! 🌟

You will have acquired a new and wonderful skill – the ability to program! 🎉 This includes developing computational thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
