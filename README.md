I assembled a number of games and tiny programs that I developed throughout the Code in Place course for my final project. 🎮💻🇹🇳 I dubbed it **"A Plethora of Games"** as it's essentially an entertaining mashup of what I've learnt, including basic guessing games, eye-catching visuals, and even some robot Karel puzzles. 🤖🎨🇹🇳

Creating these projects allowed me to practice and see how much my Python skills had grown. 🐍📈🇹🇳 Some things were challenging at first, particularly when I first started working with visuals and user interaction, but it was really satisfying to figure things out and create something that looks nice and works. 😊✨🇹🇳

I liked how every project presented a distinct challenge to me; sometimes it included math and logic, ➕🔢🇹🇳 and other times it involved creating an entertaining and engaging game. 🎉🕹️🇹🇳 It inspired me to keep going and take risks. 🚀🔥🇹🇳

All in all, this collection demonstrates my progress since the beginning. 📚🔍🇹🇳 It's been an enjoyable, occasionally annoying, 😅 but consistently fulfilling experience. 🙌🇹🇳 I'm pleased with the work I produced and want to continue learning and developing even more amazing projects in the future. 🌟🚀🇹🇳

## Code in Place 2025: My Final Submission 🚀💻✨

Welcome to the README.md for my final project! This course has been an incredible journey, and I'm thrilled to share what I've learned. 🎓

## 🎓 About Code in Place 💻

Code in Place is a truly fantastic and free introductory programming course, meticulously designed to introduce the world of coding through the versatile Python language. 🐍 Its curriculum is directly inspired by the first half of Stanford University's highly-regarded introductory computer science course, CS106A.

## 💡 No Prior Experience? No Problem! ✨

This course assumes absolutely no prior programming experience. Whether you've never even considered what a "variable" is, or if the thought of writing a single line of code seems daunting, this course was crafted with YOU in mind! 👶➡️👨‍💻

## 📚 What You Get (and Don't Get!) 🎯

This course does not provide a formal grade or university credit. 📜 Instead, it focuses on the acquisition of practical skills and knowledge.

## ✨ The Real Reward: A New Skill! 🌟

You will have acquired a new and wonderful skill – the ability to program! 🎉 This includes developing computational thinking and problem-solving capabilities.
